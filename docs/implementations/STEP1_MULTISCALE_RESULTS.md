# Step 1: Multi-Scale Testing Results

**Attempted:** Add multi-scale coherence kernel [φ, 1, φ²]  
**Status:** ❌ Too computationally expensive  
**Next:** Move to Step 2 (curl field)

---

## What We Tried

### Implementation
```javascript
const scales = [PHI, 1.0, PHI * PHI];  // φ-scale, unit-scale, φ²-scale
const weights = [1.0, 0.6, 0.3];

// Compute weighted sum of kernels at all scales
for (each neighbor) {
    for (each scale) {
        C_rho += weight * exp(-r²/(2σ²)) * ρ;
    }
}
```

### Optimization Attempts
1. Tried single-pass computation
2. Reduced to 2 scales [φ, 1]
3. Used φ as max cutoff

### Performance Impact
- Single scale: cutoff = 4 cells, ~64 neighbors
- Multi-scale: cutoff up to 17 cells, ~4913 neighbors
- **Result:** 77× slower → browser timeout

## Finding

**Multi-scale coherence is too expensive for real-time simulation**

**Tradeoff:** Computation cost vs hierarchical structure

**Decision:** Skip multi-scale for now, focus on curl field

---

## Why Multi-Scale Matters (Theoretically)

- Would create clusters within clusters
- Would enable fractal hierarchical structure
- Would capture more natural complexity

**But:** Not practical with current computational approach

---

## Alternative Approaches (Future)

1. **Sparse computation** - Only compute at significant density cells
2. **Adaptive cutoff** - Vary cutoff based on density
3. **GPU acceleration** - Compute kernels in parallel
4. **Separate passes** - Compute each scale separately, less frequently

## Lesson Learned

**Not all enhancements are equally important**

- Multi-scale: Nice-to-have, computationally expensive
- Curl field: More impactful, computationally simpler
- Measurement: Essential for validation, computationally cheap

**Next priority:** Curl field
