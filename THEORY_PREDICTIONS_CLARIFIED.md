## Theory Says: Emergent Complexity

The SCCMU theory predicts **emergent complexity**, not delta function collapse.

### What Theory.md Actually Predicts

From the abstract (Theory.md lines 34-49):

> "We establish three distinct layers:
> - **Fundamental (Part 0):** 2+1D E8 boundary theory with forward causal chain
> - **Mathematical Structure (Parts I-XI):** Complete derivation of φ-scaling relationships
> - **Physical Projection:** Tier-1 invariants (φ-exact) + Tier-2 observables (C·φⁿ)"

### Emergent Complexity is the Goal

From `docs/theory/BLOCKERS_TO_COMPLEXITY.md`:

> "Current State:
> - ✅ Basic clustering (density aggregation)
> - ✅ Single-scale structure (φ-scale kernel)
> - ✅ Stable convergence (ρ → stable clusters)
> - ✅ Proper emergence (no fake impositions)
>
> What we're missing for full complexity:
> - ❌ Multi-scale hierarchical structure
> - ❌ Self-similar fractal patterns
> - ❌ Vortices and nonlinear dynamics
> - ❌ Topological defects
> - ❌ Biological-like patterns"

## The Real Issue

### If Delta Function Occurs

This means we're **NOT implementing the theory correctly**.

The theory predicts:
1. **Emergent structure** from coherence maximization
2. **Self-organization** with φ-scaling
3. **Complex patterns** (clusters, vortices, hierarchies)

NOT:
- Delta function collapse ✗
- Fade-out to zero ✗
- Degenerate states ✗

## What Went Wrong

### Possible Issues

1. **Functional derivative sign** - Already checked, this is correct (+2 coherence)

2. **Master equation** - Should be:
   ```
   ∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇δℱ/δρ) + ν∆ρ
   ```
   This is implemented correctly ✓

3. **Entropy term balance** - Maybe entropy term is wrong?

4. **Coherence operator** - Maybe coherence operator implementation is wrong?

5. **Numerical discretization** - Maybe finite differences introduce errors?

## Next Steps

Need to debug why it's converging to delta function when theory predicts emergent complexity.

**Question:** What specific aspect of the implementation is causing the delta function instead of the complex structures theory predicts?

Let me check the coherence operator implementation...
