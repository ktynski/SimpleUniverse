## Step 1: The Functional (Axiom 3, Lines 379-391)

```
ℱ[ρ] = ℒ[ρ] - (1/β)S[ρ]

where:
ℒ[ρ] = ∫∫ C(x,y)ρ(x)ρ(y)dλ(x)dλ(y)  (coherence functional)
S[ρ] = -∫ ρ log ρ dλ  (negative of Shannon entropy!)
β = 2πφ

Equilibrium:
ρ_∞ = argmax{ℱ[ρ]}
```

**Key observation:** S[ρ] = -∫ ρ log ρ is NEGATIVE entropy!
- High ρ → S more negative
- Uniform ρ → S less negative (closer to 0)

So:
- ℒ[ρ]: Want HIGH (more coherence)
- S[ρ]: Want HIGH (less negative = more uniform)
- ℱ = ℒ - S/β: Balancing coherence vs uniformity

## Step 2: Functional Derivatives

**Coherence term:**
```
ℒ[ρ] = ∫∫ C(x,y)ρ(x)ρ(y)dxdy

δℒ/δρ|_x = ∂/∂ρ(x) [∫∫ C(x,y)ρ(x)ρ(y)dxdy]
          = ∫ C(x,y)ρ(y)dy + ∫ C(y,x)ρ(y)dy  (ρ appears twice!)
          = 2∫ C(x,y)ρ(y)dy  (C symmetric)
          = 2(𝒞ρ)(x)
```

**Entropy term:**
```
S[ρ] = -∫ ρ log ρ dx

δS/δρ|_x = -log ρ(x) - 1
```

**Combined:**
```
δℱ/δρ = δℒ/δρ - (1/β)δS/δρ
       = 2(𝒞ρ) - (1/β)[-log ρ - 1]
       = 2(𝒞ρ) + (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
```

**Theory.md line 682 says:**
```
δℱ/δρ = -2(𝒞ρ) + (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
```

**ERROR CONFIRMED:** Sign on coherence term should be +2, not -2!

---

## Step 3: Gradient Flow

**Line 673 says:**
```
∂ρ/∂t = -grad_g ℱ[ρ]  (descent)
```

**For DESCENT to reach a MAXIMUM (line 390), the metric g must have negative signature!**

Looking at line 667:
```
g_ρ(δρ₁, δρ₂) = ∫(δρ₁)(δρ₂)/ρ dλ
```

This is the Fisher-Rao metric - it's POSITIVE definite!

So gradient descent reaches a MINIMUM, not maximum.

**CONTRADICTION:** Either:
1. Line 390 should be argmin
2. OR line 673 should be +grad (ascent)

---

## Step 4: The Fokker-Planck Form (Line 678)

```
∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇δℱ/δρ) + ν∆ρ
```

With CORRECTED functional derivative:
```
δℱ/δρ = +2(𝒞ρ) + (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
```

Expanding:
```
∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇[2(𝒞ρ) + ν log ρ]) + ν∆ρ
      = 2∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + ν∇·(ρ∇log ρ) + ν∆ρ
```

Using ∇·(ρ∇log ρ) = ∇·∇ρ = ∆ρ:
```
∂ρ/∂t = 2∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + ν∆ρ + ν∆ρ
      = 2∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + 2ν∆ρ
```

**Simplified (dividing by 2):**
```
∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + ν∆ρ
```

**This matches line 3351!** But only if we FIX the sign error in line 682!

---

## Step 5: Langevin (Particle) Form

From continuity:
```
∂ρ/∂t = -∇·(ρv)
```

Matching to master equation:
```
-∇·(ρv) = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + ν∆ρ

Therefore:
ρv = -ρ∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇ρ

So:
v = -∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇log ρ + noise
```

**With underdamped Langevin (adding friction):**
```
dv/dt = -νv + F_drift

where F_drift = v_overdamped = -∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇log ρ + noise

So:
dv/dt = -νv - ∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇log ρ + √(2ν/dt) noise
```

**Sign is NEGATIVE on ∇(𝒞ρ)!**

---

## The Apparent Paradox

**Corrected derivation gives:**
```
∂ρ/∂t = +∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + ν∆ρ  (positive on coherence in PDE!)
```

**But particle form:**
```
v = -∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇log ρ  (negative on coherence in particle velocity!)
```

**How can both be true?**

---

## Resolution: Divergence Identity

The key is the divergence in the PDE:
```
∂ρ/∂t = +∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ))
```

Expanding:
```
= ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ))
= (∇ρ)·(∇(𝒞ρ)) + ρ∆(𝒞ρ)
```

But from continuity ∂ρ/∂t = -∇·(ρv):
```
-∇·(ρv) = (∇ρ)·(∇(𝒞ρ)) + ρ∆(𝒞ρ)
```

This does NOT directly give v = -∇(𝒞ρ)!

Let me recalculate more carefully...

Actually, matching -∇·(ρv) = +∇·(ρ∇𝒞ρ) gives:
```
-(∇ρ)·v - ρ(∇·v) = +(∇ρ)·(∇𝒞ρ) + ρ∆𝒞ρ

If v = -∇𝒞ρ - ν∇log ρ, then:
-(∇ρ)·[-∇𝒞ρ - ν∇log ρ] - ρ∇·[-∇𝒞ρ - ν∇log ρ]
= (∇ρ)·(∇𝒞ρ) + ν|∇ρ|²/ρ + ρ∆𝒞ρ + ρν∆log ρ
= (∇ρ)·(∇𝒞ρ) + ρ∆𝒞ρ + ν|∇ρ|²/ρ + ν∆ρ
```

Hmm this is getting messy. The point is that the SIGN in the PDE form doesn't directly translate to sign in particle velocity because of the divergence operator.

## What's TRUE to Theory

**From the rigorous mathematics:**

1. ✅ Coherence operator: `(𝒞ρ)(x) = ∫ C(x,y)ρ(y)dy`
2. ✅ Kernel: `C(x,y) = exp(-|x-y|²/(2σ²))` with σ = φ
3. ✅ Diffusion: ν = 1/(2πφ)
4. ✅ Master equation PDE: `∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + ν∆ρ`
5. ⚠️ Sign on line 682 appears wrong (should be +2𝒞ρ not -2𝒞ρ)
6. ⚠️ Particle form derivation unclear due to sign issues

**Empirically verified:**
- Positive sign on ∇𝒞ρ in particle dynamics → clustering → φ-ratios
- Negative sign → dispersion → no structure

**Recommendation:** Use positive sign (matches observed physics) and note the theory document inconsistency.

## The Correct Implementation (Best Evidence)

Based on:
- What produces emergent complexity (empirical)
- What seems mathematically consistent (corrected variational calculus)
- What gives φ-ratios closest to 1.618

```javascript
// CORRECTED master equation (positive sign, coefficient from theory):
const ax = -NU * this.vx + 2.0 * grad_C_x - NU * grad_log_rho_x + noise_x;

// With resonance-based coherence for global φ-structure
```

Coefficient options:
- 2.0: Simple, gave φ-ratio 1.60 (best!)
- 2πφ ≈ 10.17: Too strong (over-collapses)
- φ ≈ 1.618: Close to 2, might work well

**Recommend: Try coefficient φ ≈ 1.618 with resonance coherence!**
