### 6. Grid Resolution Increase
- **Requested:** 32³ → 64³
- **Status:** Cancelled due to performance
- **Reason:** Multi-scale kernel at 64³ caused browser freeze (3.75B ops/timestep)
- **Alternative:** Single-scale φ kernel at 32³ runs smoothly
- **Future:** Implement with GPU acceleration

## 🔄 Pending (3/10)

### 8. Test Hierarchical Structure Emergence
**Status:** Ready for testing  
**Requirements:**
- Simulation running smoothly ✓
- Coherence field visualized ✓
- φ-ratio measurement active ✓

**What to Test:**
- Run simulation for extended period
- Look for clustering at φ-scale
- Check φ-ratio convergence to 1.618...
- Observe curl-driven rotational patterns
- Verify coherence-driven structure formation

**Next Steps:**
- User testing required
- Observe emergent patterns
- Validate φ-scaling in structure

### 9. Full Multi-Scale Kernel with GPU
**Status:** Deferred for performance  
**Requirements:**
- WebGL shader implementation
- GPU convolution kernels
- Compute shaders for multi-scale

**Challenge:**
- Current CPU implementation: 3.75B ops/timestep at 64³
- Browser limitations
- GPU would enable real-time multi-scale

**Technical Approach:**
```glsl
// Compute shader for multi-scale coherence
// Scale kernel on GPU
// Parallel convolution for each scale
```

**Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have enhancement)

---

### 10. Adaptive Computation Frequency
**Status:** Optimization opportunity  
**Requirements:**
- Cost analysis for each operation
- Frame rate monitoring
- Selective computation updates

**Current Performance:**
- Coherence: Every timestep
- Curl field: Every timestep
- Eigenmodes: Every timestep
- Metrics: Every 20 steps

**Proposed Optimization:**
- Compute expensive operations less frequently
- Update coherence every N steps (e.g., N=2)
- Adaptive cutoff based on density
- Sparse computation for low-density regions

**Impact:** Could enable 64³ with optimizations
