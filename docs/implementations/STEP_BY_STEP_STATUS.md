# Step-by-Step Testing Status

**Date:** January 12, 2025

---

## ✅ Step 1: Multi-Scale Kernel - COMPLETED (Testing)

**Status:** Implemented but too slow  
**Performance:** Browser timeout  
**Decision:** Skip for now, focus on simpler enhancements  
**Files:** `STEP1_MULTISCALE_RESULTS.md`

---

## ⏳ Next: Step 2: Curl Field

**Status:** Ready to implement  
**Why next:** More impactful, computationally simpler  
**Expected:** Vortices and rotational motion

---

## Current Working State

- ✅ Single-scale clustering (working)
- ✅ Proper emergence (validated)
- ✅ Good performance (60+ FPS)

---

**The step-by-step approach revealed that not all enhancements are equally feasible. Multi-scale needs optimization strategies, so we're focusing on more practical enhancements.**
