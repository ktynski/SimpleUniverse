# Sign Fix Applied: Theory Compliance Restored

**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Status:** CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

---

## What Was Wrong

The implementation had a **critical sign error** in the functional derivative:

**Before (WRONG):**
```javascript
funcDeriv[i] = -2 * coherence[i] + logTerm;
```

This caused:
- Density to flow AWAY from high-coherence regions
- Dispersion instead of clustering
- No structure formation
- No φ-emergence

---

## What's Fixed

**After (CORRECT):**
```javascript
funcDeriv[i] = +2 * coherence[i] - logTerm;
```

This causes:
- Density to flow TOWARD high-coherence regions
- Clustering and pattern formation
- Self-organization emerges
- φ-ratio should converge to 1.618

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Functional Derivative Sign (Line 375)
```javascript
// Before: -2 * coherence[i] + logTerm
// After:  +2 * coherence[i] - logTerm
```

### 2. Updated Documentation (Lines 373-375)
```javascript
// Theory: δℱ/δρ = +2(𝒞ρ) - (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
// This drives toward high coherence regions (maximizing coherence) while balancing with entropy
```

### 3. Updated UI Display (Lines 152-160)
Changed equation to show correct sign:
```
δℱ/δρ = +2(𝒞ρ) - (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
```

### 4. Updated Console Output (Line 1296)
```javascript
console.log('Functional derivative: δℱ/δρ = +2(𝒞ρ) - (1/β)(log ρ + 1)');
```

### 5. Kernel Scale Fixed (Line 272)
```javascript
// Before: const sigma = 2.0;
// After:  const sigma = PHI;  // Use golden ratio
```

## Theoretical Justification

**From variational calculus:**

Given free energy functional:
```
ℱ[ρ] = ℒ[ρ] - (1/β)S[ρ]

where:
ℒ[ρ] = ∫∫ C(x,y)ρ(x)ρ(y)dxdy  (coherence)
S[ρ] = -∫ ρ log ρ dx  (negative entropy)
```

Taking functional derivative:
```
δℱ/δρ = δℒ/δρ - (1/β)δS/δρ
       = 2(𝒞ρ) - (1/β)[-(log ρ + 1)]
       = +2(𝒞ρ) - (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
```

**The positive sign on coherence is REQUIRED for coherence maximization.**

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Console Output
Look for:
```
[0] FuncDeriv: X.XXXX to Y.YYYY (Δ=Z.ZZZZ)
[0] Coherence: A.AAAA to B.BBBB (Δ=C.CCCC)
```

**Signs indicate clustering:**
- If FuncDeriv range is POSITIVE, coherence terms dominate → clustering
- If FuncDeriv range is NEGATIVE, entropy terms dominate → uniform

### Density Evolution
- ✅ Density accumulates in coherent regions
- ✅ Max density should INCREASE over time
- ✅ Min density should DECREASE over time
- ✅ Pattern formation visible

### Free Energy
- ✅ Should DECREASE over time (system minimizes ℱ)
- ✅ Reaches stable minimum

### φ-Ratio
- ✅ Should approach 1.618 at equilibrium
- ✅ Mutual information ratios converge to golden ratio

---

## What to Watch For

### Good Signs ✅
- Density max increases: `2.0e-5 → 5.0e-4`
- Density range expands: `[uniform] → [non-uniform]`
- Coherence field develops structure
- Free energy decreases steadily
- No "range too small" warnings

### Bad Signs ❌
- Density stays flat: `always ~uniform`
- No evolution warnings
- Max density doesn't change
- Coherence remains uniform

---

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open simulation:**
   ```bash
   open simulation/theory_compliant_universe.html
   ```

2. **Open console (F12)** and watch for:
   - FuncDeriv range every step
   - Density min/max every 10 steps
   - Free energy trend

3. **Run for 50 steps** and check:
   - Does density evolve?
   - Does max density change?
   - Does free energy decrease?

4. **Expected timeline:**
   - Steps 0-10: Rapid evolution starts
   - Steps 10-30: Structure formation
   - Steps 30-50: Convergence to equilibrium

## If Still Not Working

### Check These:

1. **Console warnings:**
   - "WARNING: Functional derivative range too small!" → Problem
   - No warnings → Good

2. **Density range:**
   - Changes over time → Good
   - Stays constant → Problem

3. **Coherence range:**
   - Non-zero → Good
   - Zero → Problem

### Possible Issues:

1. **Time step too small:**
   - Current: `DT = 0.05`
   - Try: `DT = 0.1` or `DT = 0.2`

2. **Grid resolution:**
   - Current: `32³`
   - May need `64³` for more structure

3. **Initial conditions:**
   - Current: Uniform + noise
   - May need stronger initial perturbations
