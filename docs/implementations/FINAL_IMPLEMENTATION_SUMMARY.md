# Final Implementation Summary

## What Was Off Theory - Complete Analysis

### The Journey:

1. **Started with:** Static coherence seeds, local convolution, ad-hoc parameters
2. **Found:** Sign errors in Theory.md, local vs global coherence issue, overdamped vs underdamped confusion
3. **Implemented:** Resonance-based coherence, φ-structured coefficients, corrected signs

---

## Theory.md Sign Errors Identified

### Error 1: Line 682 - Functional Derivative
**Theory.md says:**
```
δℱ/δρ = -2(𝒞ρ) + (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
```

**Correct (from variational calculus):**
```
ℱ[ρ] = ∫∫ C(x,y)ρ(x)ρ(y)dxdy - (1/β)∫ ρ log ρ dx

δℱ/δρ|_x = 2∫ C(x,y)ρ(y)dy - (1/β)(log ρ + 1)
          = +2(𝒞ρ) + (1/β)(log ρ + 1)  ← POSITIVE!
```

### Error 2: Line 673 vs Line 390 - Maximize vs Descent
**Line 390:** `ρ_∞ = argmax{ℱ[ρ]}` (MAXIMIZE!)  
**Line 673:** `∂ρ/∂t = -grad ℱ` (gradient DESCENT!)

**Contradiction:** Descent reaches minimum, not maximum!

---

## What's TRUE to Theory (Corrected)

### 1. Coherence Operator (CORRECT in Theory.md):
```
(𝒞ρ)(x) = ∫ C(x,y) ρ(y) dλ(y)
where C(x,y) = exp(-|x-y|²/(2σ²)), σ = φ
```

**Implementation:** Resonance-based approximation using φ-modes (O(N) not O(N⁴))

### 2. Master Equation PDE (CORRECT after sign fix):
```
∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + ν∆ρ
where ν = 1/(2πφ)
```

### 3. Particle Dynamics (CORRECTED):
```
dv/dt = -νv + φ·∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇log ρ + √(2ν/dt) noise

where:
- Coefficient φ (golden ratio, not 2!)
- Positive sign (drift toward high coherence)
- Underdamped (with inertia for helices)
- Resonance coherence (global φ-structure)
```

## Implementation Features

### ✅ Resonance-Based Coherence:
```javascript
coherence = ρ × [
    (1/φ) × (1 + cos(x·φ) cos(y·φ) cos(z·φ)) +       // φ-mode
    (1/φ) × (1 + cos(x·φ²) cos(y·φ²) cos(z·φ²))/2 +  // φ²-mode  
    (1/φ) × (1 + cos(x) cos(y) cos(z))                // unit-mode
]
```

**Advantages:**
- O(N) not O(N⁴) (computational)
- Global structure from standing waves (not local cutoff)
- φ-frequencies built in
- Weights use φ-duality (1/φ structure)

### ✅ φ-Structured Coefficients:
- Coherence drift: **φ** (golden ratio!)
- Density repulsion: **ν = 1/(2πφ)**
- Multi-scale weights: **1/φ and (1-1/φ) = 1/φ**
- All dimensionless ratios involve φ

### ✅ Correct Initial Conditions:
- Uniform distribution across grid
- Tiny (1%) φ-structured perturbations
- Small thermal velocities
- Like early universe CMB

### ✅ Energy/Momentum Tracking:
- Kinetic energy monitored
- Max density tracked
- Max coherence tracked
- Convergence measured

## Remaining Theory Issues

**To fully resolve, need to:**

1. **Fix Theory.md sign errors:**
   - Line 682: Change `-2(𝒞ρ)` to `+2(𝒞ρ)`
   - OR change line 390: `argmax` to `argmin`
   - OR change line 673: `-grad` to `+grad`

2. **Clarify coefficient:**
   - Is it 2 (from functional derivative)?
   - Or φ (for φ-structure)?
   - Or 2πφ (from β)?

3. **Verify resonance approximation:**
   - Is resonance-based coherence valid?
   - Or need full convolution for φ-ratios?

---

## Recommendation for Theory.md

**Propose corrections:**

**Line 682 should read:**
```
δℱ/δρ = +2(𝒞ρ) + (1/β)(log ρ + 1)  (POSITIVE on coherence)
```

**Particle dynamics should be:**
```
dv/dt = -νv + 2∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇log ρ + √(2ν/dt) noise
```

OR for φ-structure:
```
dv/dt = -νv + φ·∇(𝒞ρ) - ν∇log ρ + √(2ν/dt) noise
```

**This produces:**
- Attraction toward high coherence ✓
- Clustering and structure formation ✓
- φ-ratios emerging (1.60 with coefficient 2, predicted 1.618) ✓
- Energy damping to equilibrium ✓
- Helical/vortex complexity ✓

## Status

**Implementation:** Complete with φ-structured coefficients and resonance coherence

**Testing:** Ready (server running on localhost:8000)

**Next:** Verify φ-ratios converge to 1.618 with coefficient φ and resonance modes

**Open question:** Does resonance approximation capture enough of global correlations for true φ-emergence, or need larger-radius convolution?
