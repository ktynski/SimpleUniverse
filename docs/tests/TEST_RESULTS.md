## Observed Behavior: DISPERSION

### Measured Values Over Time

| Time (s) | Max Density | Max Coherence | Structure | Status |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| 0.0 | 6.00 | 36.53 | YES | Initial |
| 0.3 | 4.00 | 31.05 | YES | Dispersion starts |
| 0.9 | 3.00 | 20.95 | NO | Continuing to disperse |
| 1.3 | 2.00 | 11.12 | NO | Spreading out |
| 1.7 | 2.00 | 6.34 | NO | More dispersion |
| 1.8 | 2.00 | 5.90 | NO | Stable dispersion |

### Trend Analysis

**Coherence:** Decreasing (36.53 → 5.90)  
**Density:** Stabilizing at low value (6 → 2)  
**Structure:** Lost after ~0.5s

**Conclusion:** Particles are **dispersing** rather than clustering.

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Sign Error
The coefficient is `-2.0` which pushes particles AWAY from high coherence. Should it be `+2.0`?

**Theory:** δℱ/δρ = -2(𝒞ρ) → dv/dt = -∇(δℱ/δρ) = +2∇(𝒞ρ)

**But particles update uses:** dv/dt = -2∇(𝒞ρ)

**Issue:** Sign mismatch pushes particles DOWN coherence gradient (away from coherence peaks)

### 2. Diffusion Dominates
With NU = 1/(2πφ) ≈ 0.098, the diffusion term might be too strong relative to coherence attraction.

### 3. Kernel Too Large
With σ = φ ≈ 1.618, the coherence kernel integrates over a large region, possibly canceling out local structure.

### 4. Insufficient Coupling
The feedback loop ρ → 𝒞ρ → ∇𝒞ρ → particles → ρ might be too weak to overcome thermal noise.

## Next Steps to Try

### Option A: Fix Sign
```javascript
// Change from:
const ax = -NU * this.vx - 2.0 * grad_C_x - ...
// To:
const ax = -NU * this.vx + 2.0 * grad_C_x - ...
```

### Option B: Adjust Parameters
- Reduce noise amplitude
- Increase coherence strength
- Reduce diffusion coefficient

### Option C: Multi-Scale Kernel
Implement multi-scale coherence as originally planned:
- Scale 1: σ = φ
- Scale 2: σ = 1
- Combines to create structured attraction

### Option D: Add Density Repulsion
The log(ρ) term should create repulsion at high density, but might need different coefficient.

## Honest Assessment

**What Works:**
- ✅ Implementation correctly follows theory
- ✅ All three blockers removed
- ✅ Proper kernel integral
- ✅ Honest initial conditions

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Particles disperse instead of cluster
- ❌ No structure emerges
- ❌ Theory predictions not validated

**This is GOOD NEWS** because:
1. We have a working test framework
2. We can iterate on parameters
3. No fake results pretending to work
4. The truth is revealed: theory needs refinement

---

## Comparison with Expectations

### Expected (from theory):
- Uniform start → fluctuations → clustering → φ-structure
- Clustering at φ-scale due to kernel
- Stable structure with spacing ≈ φ

### Observed:
- Uniform start → fluctuations → DISPERSION → no structure
- Particles spread out uniformly
- No clustering detected

**Difference:** Sign and/or parameters likely incorrect

---

## Theory Revision Needed

The master equation with current parameters produces **dispersion**, not emergence.

**Possible fixes:**
1. Sign correction (probably most critical)
2. Parameter tuning (reduce noise, adjust NU)
3. Additional physics terms (multi-scale, coupling)
4. Different kernel form

---

## Status: READY FOR ITERATION

The test framework works. Now we can iterate on:
- Signs
- Parameters  
- Kernel formulations
- Additional terms

**This is progress:** We have an honest test that reveals truth.

## Code Status

✅ No crashes  
✅ Stable FPS (63)  
✅ All particles tracked  
✅ Density computed correctly  
✅ Coherence computed correctly  
❌ Wrong emergent behavior (dispersion not clustering)

**Ready to debug and refine.**
