## Key Deviations from Theory

### 1. **Particle Approximation of Continuum PDE**

**Theory:** Master equation is a CONTINUUM partial differential equation:
```
∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + Δρ/(2πφ)
```
This should be solved on a continuous field.

**We do:** Particle simulation where density is:
```
ρ(x,t) = Σ_i δ(x - x_i(t))
```
Then compute forces on particles from this density.

**Question:** Does particle motion actually satisfy the continuum PDE?

**Test:**
```
Particle flux: ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0
Our forces give: v = F + ∇(𝒞ρ) + ...

Do these combine to: ∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + Δρ/(2πφ)?
```

**Status:** ❌ NOT VERIFIED - may not be solving correct equation!

---

### 2. **Grid Resolution vs Particle Scale**

**Current:**
- Grid: 32³ cells over [-10, 10]
- Cell size: 0.625 units
- Particles: 50,000 in same volume

**Problem:**
- ~50,000 particles / 32,768 cells = 1.5 particles/cell average
- **Density field is VERY noisy!** (mostly 0 or 1 or 2)
- Coherence operator sees noise, not smooth field
- Master equation assumes SMOOTH ρ(x,t)

**Theory requires:**
- Either: Many particles per cell (smooth density)
- Or: Finer grid (but too expensive)
- Or: Smoothing kernel in density computation

**Impact:** Master equation may not work correctly with noisy ρ!

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Smooth density deposition
for each particle at (x,y,z):
    for each nearby cell:
        weight = kernel(distance)
        cell.density += weight
// Instead of just depositing in one cell
```

**Status:** ❌ Density too noisy for proper master equation

---

### 3. **Force Balance / Natural Units**

**Theory:** All forces should be in natural units where φ sets the scale.

**Current mix:**
```javascript
F = ∇S(A)                    // Natural scale from entropy
ME = ∇(𝒞ρ) × 1/(2πφ) × 0.5  // Artificially weakened!
curl×v × 0.3                 // Ad hoc strength
diffusion × 0.02             // Weakened
```

**Problem:** We've tuned these by hand to "look good", not from theory!

**Theory says:**
```
dv/dt = F + ∇(𝒞ρ) + curl×v + diffusion
```
All terms should have NATURAL relative strengths from the equations, not tuned!

**Status:** ⚠️ Force balance is ad hoc, not derived

---

### 4. **No Verification of φ-Scaling**

**Theory predicts:** Observable ratios involve φ:
- Structure sizes should be φ, φ², φ³ apart
- Rotation periods should have φ-ratios
- Coherence eigenvalue λ_max ~ φ^k

**We measure:**
- Nothing! No quantitative analysis of outputs

**Should do:**
```javascript
// Measure structure correlation lengths
// Check if they're φ-spaced
// Measure rotation periods  
// Compute λ_max of coherence operator
// Verify φ-structure in ALL observables
```

**Status:** ❌ No verification theory predictions hold

---

### 5. **No Equilibrium / Convergence Test**

**Theory:** System should converge to fixed point:
```
ρ(x,t) → ρ_∞(x) as t → ∞
𝒞ρ_∞ = λ_max ρ_∞
Convergence: ||ρ_t - ρ_∞|| ~ e^(-γt)
```

**We do:**
- Just run evolution
- Don't check if converging
- Don't know what ρ_∞ should be
- Don't measure convergence rate

**Should do:**
```javascript
// Run for long time
// Check if ρ stops changing
// Measure ||ρ_t - ρ_{t-Δt}|| → 0?
// Extract ρ_∞
// Verify it's eigenfunction of 𝒞
```

**Status:** ❌ Don't know if reaching equilibrium

---

### 6. **Missing Metric Emergence**

**Theory:** Spacetime metric emerges from density:
```
g_μν(x) = ∂_μ∂_ν log ρ_∞(x)
```

**We could compute:**
```javascript
// Hessian of log(density)
g_xx = ∂²(log ρ)/∂x²
g_xy = ∂²(log ρ)/∂x∂y
// ... 10 components total

// Then check: Does it satisfy Einstein equations?
R_μν - ½Rg_μν = 8πG T_μν
```

**We don't:**
- Compute metric at all
- Check Einstein equations
- Verify emergent geometry

**Status:** ❌ Major theory component not tested

---

### 7. **Quantum vs Classical**

**Theory:** Fibonacci anyons are QUANTUM objects
```
|ψ⟩ = α|1⟩ + β|τ⟩
Braiding = unitary operation
Fusion channels = quantum superposition
```

**We do:**
- Classical particles with definite positions
- Braiding as classical interference sin(d₁)×sin(d₂)
- No quantum superposition
- No topological charge

**Impact:**
- Missing quantum entanglement
- Missing topological protection
- Missing coherence in quantum sense

**Status:** ⚠️ Classical approximation of quantum theory

---

### 8. **Time Evolution Correctness**

**Theory:** Master equation has specific time evolution:
```
∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + Δρ/(2πφ)
```

**Our particle update:**
```javascript
v += F + ∇(𝒞ρ) + curl×v + diffusion
x += v × dt
```

**Implicit density evolution:**
```
∂ρ/∂t = -∇·(ρv)
where v = F + ∇(𝒞ρ) + ...
```

**Does -∇·(ρv) = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + Δρ/(2πφ)?**

**This requires:**
```
ρv = -ρ∇(𝒞ρ) - diffusion_flux
```

**But we have:**
```
v = F + ∇(𝒞ρ) + curl×v + random
```

**The F and curl terms don't appear in master equation!**

**Status:** ❌ Particle evolution ≠ master equation evolution

---

## Bottom Line

### What We Have:
**A particle simulation with:**
- Density-dependent forces
- Multi-scale attraction (coherence)
- Vorticity (curl)
- Fibonacci modulation
- Physical limits

**This DEMONSTRATES the mechanisms, but doesn't PROVE they're solving the theory equations correctly.**

### What We're Missing:
1. **Proof** particle evolution solves master equation
2. **Smooth density field** (currently too noisy)
3. **Natural force balance** (currently tuned by hand)
4. **Quantitative verification** of φ-scaling
5. **Convergence to ρ_∞** 
6. **Metric emergence** check
7. **Quantum mechanics** (classical approx only)

### For Minimal Demo:
**Current implementation is SUFFICIENT to show:**
- "Here's what happens with master equation + curl + braiding"
- "You get emergent structure from nothing"
- "It's complex and beautiful"

### For Rigorous Theory Validation:
**Would need:**
- Continuum PDE solver (not particles)
- Quantitative measurements
- φ-scaling verification
- Convergence tests
- Metric extraction
- Quantum simulation

## Most Critical Gap

**The particle approximation may not actually solve the master equation!**

The master equation is:
```
∂ρ/∂t = ∇·(ρ∇(𝒞ρ)) + Δρ/(2πφ)
```

But we're solving:
```
∂ρ/∂t = -∇·(ρv)
where v = ∇S + ∇(𝒞ρ) + curl×v + random
```

These are DIFFERENT equations unless ∇S = -∇(𝒞ρ) and other terms cancel, which is NOT generally true!

**We're simulating SOMETHING, but it may not be the master equation from theory.**
